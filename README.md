# **CAPE Instructor Recommendation Rates**
*Kacie Li, Van Nguyen, Andrew Pan, Kaushika Uppu*

The practice of Student Evaluations of Teaching (SET) is widespread across colleges and universities globally. Originating in the early 1920s, these evaluations are typically conducted at the conclusion of each academic term to gather insights from students regarding their experiences with instructors and courses. SET questionnaires commonly comprise a series of questions prompting students to assess their instructor’s performance in areas such as clarity, organization, engagement, and overall effectiveness1. At UCSD, these evaluations are made public on Course and Professor Evaluations (CAPE), a platform managed by students to showcase collegiate opinions. With a response rate exceeding 50%, CAPE results are utilized by administrators and instructors to identify strengths and weaknesses, refine teaching methods, and furnish evidence for tenure and promotion decisions.

Moreover, UCSD students frequently rely on CAPE for professor and course recommendations when making decisions about which classes and instructors to choose. Nevertheless, the reliability, validity, and potential bias of SET have been subjects of criticism2. Despite these concerns, student evaluations of teaching persist as a widely-utilized tool for evaluating and enhancing instructional quality in higher education3.

Recent research has illuminated various factors influencing student evaluations of teaching. These encompass conventional elements such as course load, course materials, and a professor’s years of experience, as well as less conventional aspects like teaching style, attitude and even race and gender4. Studies also indicate that SET not only assess professors’ performance but also mirror the effectiveness of student learning. Given that many students heavily rely on CAPE for information on course and professor evaluations, our team is intrigued by the factors most impactful on students’ ratings of teaching instructor. Leveraging data from UCSD’s CAPE, our project aims to assess how specific factors influence the recommendation rate of instructors in a specific course.
